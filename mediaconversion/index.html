                    <mark>FANTASY</mark> It takes a while to unpack the backstory of the surprisingly powerful <i>Black Widow</i>, a stand-alone
                    adventure starring Scarlett Johansson after her turns as Natasha Romanoff in all those other Marvel films.
                    We start with a childhood prologue in Ohio, 1995: Little Natasha is being raised by two Soviet spies
                    (David Harbour and Rachel Weisz) along with another girl, named Yelena. Natasha and Yelena wind up in the USSR,
                     where they're trained by the Soviets to become assassin-spies as part of a barbaric brainwashing program called
                    the Red Room. Natasha, we know, escapes to become an Avenger. The grown-up yelena (Florence Pugh), on the other hand,
                    accepts her destiny as a killing machine- until she's almost magically liberated from

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    the Red Room spell, like Princess Aurora shaken awake from her prolonged nap. She and Natasha reunite to destroy the Red Room and the villian behind it,
                    Dreykov (Ray Winstone). <i>Black Widow</i> at times has trouble striking balance between its big-scale action scenes and the somber, serious theme
                    of cruelty to women (during a high-altitude escape, Yelena, with ironic casualness, discusses how Dreykov forced her to have a hysterectomy).
                    But Johansson and Pugh, two excellent actresses who can deliver maximum emotional impact without fuss, forge a strong bond that, in the end,
                    gives <i>Widow</i> a deeper resonance than many Avengers movies. <i>(Launches July 9; also in theaters; PG-13) For more on David Harbour, see page 88.</i>
